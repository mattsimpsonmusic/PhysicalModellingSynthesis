# PhysicalModellingSynthesis

This project creates a sound design tool capable of producing a range of different sounds using the Karplus Strong plucked string model in MATLAB.

The focus on the design for this system was the range of sounds the model is capable of producing, exploring ways to vary timbre such as distortion,
reverb, mulitple strings, reverse, chorus, and membrane application.
